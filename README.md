Welcome to the Teacher-Student Network project repository! This project focuses on implementing a neural network architecture known as a "teacher-student network" and utilizing the technique of knowledge distillation.

## Overview

In a teacher-student network, a smaller, simpler network (the student) is trained to replicate the behavior of a larger, more complex network (the teacher). The student network learns from the intermediate representations of the teacher network, which are used as "hints" or "soft targets," rather than directly minimizing the prediction error. This process is known as knowledge distillation.

## Advantages

Some advantages of using a teacher-student network include:

- **Faster Training**: The student network learns faster and more effectively by leveraging the intermediate representations of the teacher network, rather than starting from scratch.
- **Improved Generalization**: Knowledge distillation helps in minimizing overfitting and enhancing the generalization capabilities of the student network by incorporating regularization effects from the teacher network.
- **Model Compression**: The student network is typically simpler and smaller than the teacher network, leading to increased computational efficiency and making it easier to implement in resource-constrained environments.

## Implementation Details

- **Neural Network Architecture**: Implement a teacher-student network architecture, with the teacher network providing soft targets for the student network during training.
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Train the student network to mimic the behavior of the teacher network by learning from its intermediate representations.
